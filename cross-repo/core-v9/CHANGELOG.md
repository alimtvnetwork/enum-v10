# Changelog

All notable changes to **enum-v10** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The release pipeline extracts the matching `## [vX.Y.Z]` section as the
GitHub Release body — keep entries small, sectioned, and human-readable.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **CI/CD pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — SHA dedup, `golangci-lint`,
  `govulncheck`, 4-suite parallel test matrix, aggregated test summary,
  60% coverage gate, and `go build ./...` smoke check.
- **Weekly vulnerability scan** (`.github/workflows/vulncheck.yml`) — scheduled
  `govulncheck` run with two-tier classification (fail on third-party,
  warn on stdlib).
- **Release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — triggers on
  `release/**` branches and `v*` tags; produces source archives, SHA-256
  checksums, and a GitHub Release whose body is extracted from this file.
- **Reusable CI guards** (`.github/workflows/ci-guards.yml`):
  - `scripts/ci/check-collisions.py` — per-package identifier collision
    audit (cross-file, case-insensitive, intra-file). GOOS/GOARCH build-tag
    siblings and Exported/unexported accessor pairs are recognised and
    excluded from false positives.
  - `scripts/ci/lint-baseline-diff.py` — lint gate that fails only on
    **new** `golangci-lint` findings; baseline cached per `main` push and
    seeded from `.ci-baselines/golangci-lint.json` on cold cache.
- **Spec docs**: `spec/04-tooling/00-overview.md` (tooling index/landing
  page), `02-release-pipeline.md`, `03-vulnerability-scanning.md`,
  `04-bootstrap-into-new-repo.md`, `04-ci-guards.md`,
  `05-branch-protection.md`, `06-cross-repo-sync.md`.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — local dev (`./run.sh`), commit conventions,
  release procedure.
- `.golangci.yml`, `CODEOWNERS`, `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
  (now with structured local / CI-guard / cross-repo checklists),
  `.gitattributes`.
- **Dependabot** (`.github/dependabot.yml`) — weekly `gomod` and
  `github-actions` updates, grouped minor/patch PRs, scheduled Mondays
  09:00 Asia/Kuala_Lumpur.
- **Cross-repo staging** under `cross-repo/core-v9/` — mirrored
  workflows, `.golangci.yml`, `dependabot.yml`, baselines, and a
  README install guide so the `core-v8` upstream can adopt the same
  CI surface (governed by `spec/04-tooling/06-cross-repo-sync.md`).
- **Python regression tests** for the CI guards:
  `scripts/ci/test_check_collisions.py` (22 cases covering build-tag
  collapsing, accessor pairs, decl parsing, string/comment skipping,
  per-package scoping) and `scripts/ci/test_lint_baseline_diff.py`
  (15 cases covering load/identity rules, seeding mode, gate mode,
  exit codes, summary counts).

### Changed
- Module path migrated from `gitlab.com/auk-go/enum` to
  `github.com/alimtvnetwork/enum-v10`.
- **Core dependency renamed** `github.com/alimtvnetwork/core-v8` →
  `github.com/alimtvnetwork/core-v8` across all 307 source files
  (`go.mod`, all package imports, spec docs, CI configs, coverage
  scripts, PR template). The `cross-repo/core-v9/` staging directory
  name is intentionally retained — it tracks the upstream repo name,
  not the module path. Pseudo-version pin
  `v1.5.6-0.20260423064907-72bcd64c06b5` carries over unchanged.
- Dependency `gitlab.com/auk-go/core` replaced with
  `github.com/alimtvnetwork/core-v8`, pinned to pseudo-version
  `v0.0.0-20260423064907-72bcd64c06b5` (commit `72bcd64` on
  `feature/1.5.6`) so CI can resolve the module deterministically.
- **`go.mod` pseudo-version downgraded** from
  `v1.5.6-0.<date>-<sha>` to `v0.0.0-<date>-<sha>`. The `v1.5.6-0.`
  form requires a preceding `v1.5.5` tag on the upstream `core-v9`
  repo, which doesn't exist (the v8 repo had v1.5.5; v9 was just
  renamed and has no tags yet). The `v0.0.0-` form has no predecessor
  requirement. Re-pin to a real `vX.Y.Z` tag once `core-v9` upstream
  ships its first tagged release.

### CI
- `ci-guards.yml` gained a `python-tests` job that runs all
  `scripts/ci/test_*.py` via `unittest discover`. The existing
  `collision-audit` and `lint-baseline-diff` jobs now `needs:
  python-tests` so a broken gate script fails fast before the slower
  jobs spend CI minutes producing meaningless results.
- `scripts/CoveragePreChecks.psm1` — auto-fixer and bracecheck steps
  now skip gracefully (with `Register-Phase ... "skip"`) when
  `scripts/autofix/` or `scripts/bracecheck/` are absent from the
  repo, instead of hard-failing the entire `./run.ps1 -tc` run.
- **`scripts/bracecheck/`** (NEW Go tool, ~210 lines + README) —
  fast syntax pre-check. Lexical brace/bracket/paren balance
  validation (skips strings, runes, comments) plus a full
  `parser.AllErrors` pass over every `.go` file. Reports issues as
  `<relpath>:<line>:<col>: <message>`. Verified clean on 637 files.
- **`scripts/autofix/`** (NEW Go tool, ~165 lines + README) —
  conservative auto-fixer. Trims trailing whitespace, collapses 3+
  blank lines to 2, ensures one trailing newline, runs
  `format.Source`. Idempotent. Files that don't parse are skipped
  with a warning so bracecheck pinpoints the syntax issue. Supports
  `--dry-run`. With both tools restored, `./run.ps1 -tc` no longer
  prints the "scripts/autofix/ not present" skip notice.
- **`.github/workflows/python-tests.yml`** (NEW) — standalone runner
  for the CI-guard Python tests, triggered on `v*` tags, manual
  dispatch, and `scripts/ci/**` changes. Matrix tests across Python
  3.10/3.11/3.12. Complements the in-line `python-tests` job in
  `ci-guards.yml` by also catching releases and long-lived branches.

### Docs
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — pre-push checklist rewritten as checkboxes
  mirroring `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`; Spec References now
  links to `spec/04-tooling/00-overview.md` plus all six tooling
  spec files (00–06).
- `.ci-baselines/README.md` — fully documents the seed-then-gate
  workflow: seeding mode (warnings, never blocks), gating mode
  (NEW/FIXED/UNCHANGED diff with exit codes), mode-transition
  commands, and reviewer guidance for baseline drift.
